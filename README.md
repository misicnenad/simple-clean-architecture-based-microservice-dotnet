# A Simple Clean Architecture Based Microservice (.NET)
A simple "Clean Architecture" based microservice (and a helper project), written in .NET, created as a simple reference on how things can, to put it in simple terms, be done simply.

"Simplicity" cannot be overstated.

Elegancy is what we're trying to achieve.

Elegancy through Simplicity.
